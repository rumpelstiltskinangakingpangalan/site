														<h2><center>Fujifilm XS-10 vs. Fujifilm XT-4 Comparison</center></h2>
														<br>
														
														<h4 class = "titleWhite">1567 words &emsp; 100% unique</h4>
														
														<br><br>
														<p>The Fujifilm X-S10 and Fujifilm X-T4 are two of the most popular cameras on the market today. They both have their pros and cons, but which one is the better choice for you? In this article, we will compare the two cameras and see which one comes out on top.</p>
														<br><br>
														<h2>Introduction</h2>
														<br>
														<p>The Fujifilm X-T4 is the flagship model in the company's X series and is currently our preferred APS-C camera. When compared to the already excellent X-T3, we found that its in-body stabilization, enhanced AF tracking, and larger battery provided significant advantages, especially if you shoot video.</p>
														<br>
														<p>However, the company's mid-range X-S10 shares many of the features and capabilities of the X-T4 and offers in-body stabilization at a much more affordable price point. Does the less expensive camera have everything you require, or is the flagship model better value?</p>
														<br>
														<p>We'll examine the variables you might want to think about.</p>
														<br><br>
														
														<h2>1. First look</h2><br>
														
														<p>The handling characteristics of the two cameras may be their most significant difference. With dedicated dials for shutter speed and ISO, and presuming you'll use the aperture ring that's present on most X-mount lenses, the X-T4 looks and functions like an early automatic film SLR.</p>
														<br>

														<p>The X-S10, in contrast, uses a conventional mode dial to select the exposure mode and unmarked command dials to change important exposure settings. Exposure mode on the X-T4 is determined by which settings dials are in the "A" auto position.</p>
														<br>

														<p>The X-T4 also has command dials, which you can use to control exposure if you'd prefer. You can delegate control for a more DSLR-like experience by changing the dial positions and menu settings.</p>

														<br>
														<p>Their respective sizes and construction are additional differences between the two cameras. In comparison to other midrange ILC cameras, the X-S10 feels fairly sturdy, but it lacks the X-extensive T4's magnesium alloy construction and weather sealing, which means it might not be able to withstand the same level of intensive use over the long term.
														</p>
														<br>
														<p>Additionally, the bigger body of the X-T4 allows for more control points. Its full four-way controller, which contributes to its total of nine customizable buttons, is the most important feature. Six unique buttons are present on the X-S10. The touchscreens of both cameras allow you to assign four different functions to directional swipes.
														</p>
														<br><br>
														
														<h2>2. Grip and Handling</h2><br>
														
														<p>Despite being the larger camera, the X-T4's handgrip is not as strong. In contrast to the X-S10's grip, which allows a full-fingered hold, there is a respectable bulge on the front of the camera that, when combined with the thumb-rest on the back, provides a secure way to hold the camera. However, this bulge is more reminiscent of SLRs from the late 1980s.
														</p>
														<br>
														<p>Although the X-T4 has third-party bolt-on grips and Fujifilm's own battery grip offers more of a handhold, users of contemporary DSLRs will likely find the X-S10 to be more comfortable.</p>
														<br><br>
														
														<h2>3. Performance</h2><br>
														<p>With a maximum shutter speed of 1/8000 sec and the ability to shoot at up to 15 frames per second and 8 frames per second with live view, the X-T4 has a more advanced mechanical shutter mechanism. It is better at shooting action than the X-S10, whose shutter limits it to 8 fps without live view and can only shoot at up to 1/4000 sec. This is due to a buffer that is roughly twice as deep. Despite its slower card slot, the X-S10 can keep up with the X-20 T4's frames per second shooting rate when used in e-shutter mode, albeit for half the time.</p>
														<br>
														<p>Additionally, the X-S10's image stabilization is deemed to be marginally less efficient than the X- T4's. Since we haven't observed any differences between the two on a daily basis, we must draw the conclusion that these differences are most likely to be present in more extreme conditions when using specific lenses and prolonged exposure times.</p>
														<br><br>
														
														<h2>4. Autofocus</h2><br>
														
														<p>Autofocus is one area where we haven't noticed many differences. With subject tracking that stuck to the intended subject much better and an interface that made it clear that it was doing so, the X-T4 represented a significant advancement for Fujifilm. The camera is capable of producing very good results, but we discovered that we needed to adjust a number of settings in order to get close to the amount of in-focus images that the most recent Sony, Canon, and Nikon cameras now produce effortlessly. The good news is that the X-S10 costs less while providing comparable performance.</p><br>
														
														<p>Although occasionally prone to detecting faces where no faces are present, both cameras are fairly good at detecting faces and eyes. You can set up the AF joystick on the X-S10 to switch between various faces in a scene (which can be overridden by tapping the joystick inwards). The X-T4 doesn't remember this setting when you turn the camera off and requires customizing a button to access "Face Selection" mode. The AF systems of the two cameras are only significantly different in this regard.</p><br>
														
														<p>Once more, video AF is quite good, and as to be expected, you can control its speed and refocusing attempts. Although face detection on both cameras works well, there is no subject tracking available in video mode, making it impossible to keep track of other subjects and uncertain of what will happen if the camera momentarily loses track of the face you wanted it to remain focused on.</p><br>
														
														<br>
														<h2>5. Viewfinders</h2><br>
														<p>Once more, it comes as no surprise that the X-T4 has a better viewfinder than the X-S10 thanks to its 3.69M dot panel rather than the latter's lower-res 2.36M dot display. Although there has only been a 25% increase in linear resolution, the difference is much larger than it might appear. This is why I say "significantly."</p><br>
														
														<p>With its smaller viewfinder panel and finder optics, the X-S10's viewfinder has an eyepoint of 17.5mm and 0.62x magnification (the maximum distance from which you can see the whole panel). The X-T4 offers a more generous eyepoint of 23mm and a much more impressive 0.75x magnification (slightly larger than the finders found in the most expensive Pro-grade DSLRs). In particular for those who wear glasses, the X-T4 provides a much nicer view of the world thanks to this and a larger, more cushioned eye cup.</p><br>
														
														<br>
														<h2>6. Battery</h2><br>
														
														<p>Battery life is another notable distinction. Instead of the outdated W126S battery, the X-T4 makes use of a larger W235 battery. The X-T4 is rated to offer 175 more shots per charge than its less expensive counterpart, which is rated to offer 325. This difference can be seen in part in the battery life numbers.</p><br>
														
														<p>But more than usual, those figures don't really tell the whole story. While the X-T4 only does this when its Economy mode is activated, the X-S10 enters a low-power mode after about 12 seconds of inactivity. A more comparable comparison between this economy mode and the X-S10's standard mode reveals that the X-T4 can shoot for about 85% longer than the X-S10.</p><br>
														
														<p>It will probably make a big difference if you use your camera for long photography, if you want to record videos, or if you are traveling and may not be using the charging (USB) option for a while. long.</p><br>
														
														<p>The X-T4 has a dedicated door for its twin UHS-II card bays, whereas the X-S10's single UHS-I card slot is located in the camera's battery bay. While the X-T4 has a flash sync port and support for threaded or 2.5mm remote releases, the X-S10 has an integrated flash, which the larger camera does not.</p><br>
														
														<br>
														<h2>7. Video</h2><br>
														<p>The most significant performance differences may be seen in video. Even though the two cameras share many of the same parts, it makes sense that Fujifilm would want to save some of the more potent features for its flagship model.</p><br>
														
														<p>With DCI or UHD 4K footage oversampled from the entire width of the sensor or 60p footage captured with a slight crop, the X-T4's video specification is still among the best on the market. A number of compression methods, including 10-bit 4:2:0 H.265 recording at up to 400Mbps, are available for saving video content. There are several capture tools available, and an IS boost mode is available if you want to eliminate any camera movement.</p><br>
														
														<p>The X-S10 is unable to record video in 10-bit resolution, shoot at 60 frames per second, or use the more energy-efficient H.265 codec. The majority of the X-other T4's features, such as F-Log capture and the choice to output a 10-bit 4:2:2 signal over HDMI if you find that you like video enough to add an external recorder, are still available. With the exception of the X-T4, the X-S10 is a very impressive video option when compared to other APS-C cameras thanks to features like Boost IS, tally lights, zebras, peaking, and the articulated screen.</p><br>
														
														<br>
														<h2>Conclusion</h2><br>
														<p>The X-T4 is, as you might anticipate, slightly superior to the X-S10 in almost every category. After all, its list price is 70% higher. It is reasonable to question whether you require the full power of the larger camera, though, given that they both offer the same image quality and very comparable AF performance.</p><br>
														
														<p>If you're at all interested in shooting video that you intend to color grade and edit, the X-T4 is the obvious choice due to its superior capabilities, but the X-S10 is still a very capable video camera. The larger viewfinder, more control points, and more durable build again hold a lot of appeals if you want a stills camera to really enjoy or that will withstand some abuse. But it's impossible to deny the X-S10's incredible value, and for many people, an X-S10 and an additional lens may be the more desirable combination.</p>
