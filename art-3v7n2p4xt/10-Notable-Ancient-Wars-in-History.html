														<h2><center>10 Notable Ancient Wars in History</center></h2>
														<br>
														<h4 class = "titleWhite">1195 words &emsp; 100% unique</h4>
														
														<br><br>
														<p>War has been a part of human civilization for almost as long as civilization itself. Throughout history there have been epic battles fought over land, resources, religion, and ideology. In this article, we will explore 10 of the most notable ancient wars in history. Although there are literally thousands of ancient wars that could be discussed, the wars chosen for this list are ones that helped to shape the course of history.
														</p><br>
														<br>
														<h2>The Battle of Kadesh (1274 B.C.E)</h2><br>
														
														<p>This conflict between the New Kingdom of Egypt (ruled by Ramses II) and the Hittite Empire took place on the banks of the Orontes River, not far from the modern borders of Syria and Lebanon. It is the earliest conflict in history where the details of troop formations or military tactics are known. With more than 5,000 chariots involved, more than 2,000 of which were destroyed, it is thought to be the biggest chariot battle in recorded history. It also produced the earliest still-existing peace treaty, also known as the Eternal Treaty or the Silver Treaty.</p><br>
														
														<br>
														<h2>The Battle of Muye (1046 B.C.E)</h2><br>
														
														<p>The Zhou dynasty, which ruled for approximately 790 years, was the longest in Chinese history. But even the most powerful dynasties had to start somewhere. The beginning of the Zhou dynasty occurred at the Battle of Muye, where a small Zhou army of about 50,000 soldiers defeated an army of more than 500,000 enemies and 170,000 armed slaves to end the Shang dynasty. Many of the slaves had been armed to protect the capital city of Yin. Yin, defected to the Zhou side, which caused a sizable number of Shang soldiers to also defect. Others displayed a lack of interest in engaging in combat with the more skilled Zhou by holding their spears upside down.</p><br>
														
														<br>
														<h2>The Battle of Plataea (479 B.C.E)</h2><br>
														
														<p>Although the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the most well-known ancient battles, in large part because of exaggerated movies like 300, the Persian forces wouldn't actually be driven back by the Greeks until a battle the following year near the small town of Plataea. King Xerxes I of the First Persian Empire went on to conquer Thermopylae and enjoy victories in the lands beyond. He then came back to Asia. The Persian invasion of Greece came to an end when he abandoned half of his army, which was routed at Plataea by a group of hoplite soldiers.</p><br>
														
														<br>
														<h2>The Kalinga War (261 B.C.E)</h2><br>
														
														<p>According to the archaeologist and academic Ramesh Prasad Mohapatra in his Military History of Orissa, "No war in the history of India is as important either for its intensity or its results as the Kalinga war of Ashoka." No war in the history of mankind has so completely transformed the victor's heart from one of heinous cruelty to one of exemplary piety as this one.</p><br>
														
														<p>The Kalinga War, a brutal conflict between the coastal state of Kalinga and the Maurya Empire, which covered most of the Indian subcontinent south of the Himalayas, may have claimed up to 300,000 lives. Ashoka, the Mauryan ruler, is said to have sworn off fighting in conquest wars in the future after witnessing the bloodshed of the conflict.</p><br>

														<br>
														<h2>The Siege of Syracuse (213-212 B.C.E)</h2><br>
														
														<p>The independent Kingdom of Syracuse, which ruled over Sicily, an island that had been taken from Carthage during the First Punic War, was a close ally of the Roman Republic. Pro-Carthage factions in Syracuse caused the city to experience the pain of Roman siege once more as the Second Punic War raged.</p><br>
														
														<p>The famed polymath Archimedes lived in the city this time, though, and he devised clever contraptions to help fend off the Roman troops and extend the siege for several months. The city did not finally fall until a Roman soldier murdered Archimedes in his home, despite the Roman commander's orders that the inventor's life should be spared.</p><br>
														
														<br>

														<h2>The Battle of Gaixia (202 B.C.E)</h2><br>
														
														<p>After Liu Bang's victory at the Battle of Gaixia, which took place in what is now Suzhou, in 202 BCE, China's Han dynasty came into existence. Even though the Han forces had already achieved a number of strategic victories, they only had control over a relatively small area of China. In a conflict marked by double-crosses, captures, and attempted rescues, Han forces ultimately defeated their Chu adversaries, causing Chu leader Xiang Yu to commit suicide and opening the way for Liu Bang to anoint himself as Emperor of China, ushering in the Han dynasty.</p><br>
														
														<br>

														<h2>The Third Servile War (73-71 B.C.E)</h2><br>
														
														<p>Even if you are unfamiliar with the name of this conflict, the third and most important in a series of slave uprisings in ancient Rome, Spartacus is probably one of its commanders. When he and about 70 other slave gladiators escaped, more than 120,000 men, women, and kids joined them right away. Before being completely destroyed by eight Roman legions under the command of Marcus Licinius Crassus, they had defeated armies that were larger and better trained. Around 6,000 battle survivors were crucified along the Appian Way to make an example of the rebels and put a stop to any future uprisings.</p><br>
														
														<br>

														<h2>The Battle of Red Cliffs (208 C.E)</h2><br>
														
														<p>Near the end of China's Han dynasty, two southern warlords engaged a numerically superior northern opponent in what has been dubbed the largest naval battle in history. A much smaller force (roughly 50,000 soldiers) led by southern warlords Sun Quan and Liu Bei met Cao Cao's 800,000 soldiers in what became known as the Battle of Red Cliffs, who had been sent to conquer territory south of the Yangtze River.</p><br>
														
														<p>Although Cao Cao's leaders questioned whether or not he actually sent 800,000 reinforcements, they still believed he sent more than 200,000 soldiers. The southern warlords were vastly outnumbered in either case, but they were still able to repel their northern rival in part because of their superior naval training. This contributed to the establishment of two southern states and the start of the Three Kingdoms era in Chinese history.</p><br>
														
														<br>

														<h2>The Conquest of Tikal (378 C.E)</h2><br>
														
														<p>The eras that followed 250 C.E. and 900 C.E. have been referred to as the "classical period" of the Mayan civilization, which at the time occupied a large portion of Central America. The area was made up of numerous city-states connected by a complicated web of alliances and conflicts and has been compared to Classical Greece.</p><br>
														
														<p>Siyaj K'ak' arrived from Teotihuacan, about 25 miles northeast of modern-day Mexico City, in 378 C.E. to overthrow the rulers of several important cities, beginning with Tikal. They would then appoint new rulers supported by Teotihuacan. This established a hegemony that would last for almost as long as the Mayan civilization itself.</p><br>
														
														<br>

														<h2>The Battle of the Catalaunian Fields (451 C.E)</h2><br>
														
														<p>This conflict between Rome and their treaty-bound Germanic allies and numerous tens of thousands of Huns under the notorious Attila may not have had a decisive outcome, but it nonetheless helped to shape the history of the area and the world. It was one of the last battles of the Western Roman Empire. Attila's incursion into Gaul under Roman rule was stopped, but the Romans and their allies' ability to fight was severely limited. The outcome of the Roman Empire might have gone very differently if Attila's demise and the subsequent collapse of his empire hadn't occurred just two years later.</p><br>
