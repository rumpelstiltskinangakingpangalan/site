														<h2><center>The 4 Best Robot Vacuums of 2022</center></h2>
														
														<br>
														<h4 class = "titleWhite">952 words &emsp; 100% unique</h4>
														
														<br><br>
														<p>Robot vacuum cleaners are one of the most popular home appliances. As technology advances, these devices are becoming more and more intelligent, making them more efficient and easier to use. In this article, we will take a look at the four best robot vacuum cleaners of 2022.
														</p><br>
														<br>
														<h2>1. iRobot Roomba i3 EVO</h2><br>
														
														<p>Like most of today's great robots, the Roomba i3 EVO works well in most homes, large and small, as it moves back and forth in orderly rows, keeping track of where it has been. , so it won't miss any big transactions. area. But unlike most of its competitors, the Roomba i3 EVO is truly a solid and repairable device, and while durability can never be guaranteed, you can expect it. Expect to own it and use it regularly for years to come. It also cleans carpets better than most robots, and hair strands don't get tangled up in its brush quickly. Together with the app and Wi-Fi connection, you can turn the robot on and off and set an automatic cleaning schedule if needed. That's everything you need to know - it's that simple. The downside is that it doesn't work as fast as some competing models.</p><br>
														<p>iRobot released a software update in March 2022 that enables you to designate specific rooms for your bot to clean and customize its cleaning preferences using an app. This new function has not yet been evaluated with the i3 EVO. But you should have more control over it than you would with other smart mapping models, such as the Roborock S4 Max (more on that one shortly).</p><br>
														
														<p>The Roomba i3+ EVO package, on the other hand, includes the i3 EVO robot in addition to a charging dock that automatically suctions debris out of the robot and stores it in a disposable bag that needs to be changed only once per month. It actually functions, adding to the convenience of owning a robot. Owners appear to value it greatly.</p><br>
														
														<p>The Roomba i4 EVO, which is only available at Costco and is nearly identical to the i3 EVO, and the older but functional Roomba 900 series are two additional models that are sold by iRobot and are worth purchasing if you can find them on sale.
														</p><br>
														
														<br>
														<h2>2. Roborock S4 Max</h2><br>
														
														<p>There are at least a dozen extremely intelligent but reasonably priced robots that can quickly learn the layout of any house, clean specific rooms (or even parts of a room) on request, and ignore everything else using invisible lasers. It's a great and adaptable system if you're willing to play around with the maps in a smartphone app.</p><br>
														
														<p>There isn't any conclusive evidence to suggest that some of these laser-navigation bots are more dependable or durable than others, despite the fact that many of them have similar (and occasionally nearly identical) specifications, designs, and behaviors. However, we're inclined to suggest the Roborock S4 Max in particular because it frequently sells for around $300, making it one of the more affordable models of its ilk and because it has the most feature-rich app and controls. The Roborock and comparable laser robots' main drawbacks are that they aren't likely to last as long as iRobot's Roomba models, including our top pick, the Roomba i3 EVO, and that their single-brush designs aren't as effective at cleaning rugs.</p><br>

														<br>
														<h2>3. iRobot Roomba 694</h2><br>
														
														<p>Typically, less expensive robots have semi-random navigation systems. That's actually fine for cleaning three or four rooms per session (or a little more if you're patient), though the aimless bumbling gets on some people's nerves and isn't consistently effective at tidying up larger areas. (We like to call them bump-and-run bots.) Up until fall 2021, we actually advised the semi-random style for the majority of users, but it became evident from examining user feedback that the culture has changed. Since prices have decreased, the majority of prospective robot owners want their machines to behave professionally rather than bumbling around aimlessly and colliding with objects. However, we continue to believe that bump-and-run bots have a place, so we have moved our top picks to budget pick status.</p><br>
														
														<p>The Roomba 600 series is the first we'd advise. The fact that the Roomba is a more durable robot than any bump-and-run model from any other manufacturer, in our opinion, more than makes up for the slight price premium. Thanks to the dual-brush and dirt-detection systems, the Roomba 600 series is also a more effective cleaner than the budget robots from other brands, particularly on rugs. The most recent Roomba model with Wi-Fi (for on-off remote control via a smartphone app) is the Roomba 694, but you occasionally might be able to find a simpler model without Wi-Fi. Any of them for $250 or less is a fair price; $200 or less is a great price.</p><br>
														
														<br>

														<br>
														<h2>4. Eufy RoboVac 11S</h2><br>
														<p>The Eufy RoboVac 11S is another option. It's so quiet and agile that it blends in with the background like no other robot, except for the dozen or so Eufy clones. This simple, inexpensive bot sounds more like an ordinary desk fan than a vacuum cleaner. Even if you are home, it will barely be noticed that it is running. The 11S is shorter than other bots which allows it to glide under furniture and pick up more debris. Unfortunately, the 11S and other similar bots don't seem to have the durability to last more than two years. We've also heard of many unrepairable failures that occur even earlier. The 11S can clean your floors better than if you vacuumed at all. However, the bot isn't designed to remove much dirt from rugs, particularly thicker or softer rugs. The 11S, like the Roomba 600 series and most bots in this price bracket, is semi-random and works best when used in small spaces.</p>
